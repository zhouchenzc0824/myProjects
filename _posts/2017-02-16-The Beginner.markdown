Hi，这里是Mr.zhou。花费了好多时间，终于启动了自己的个人portfolio和blog网站用jekyll部署在GitHub pages上，纯粹感觉很好玩。使用Jekyll来搭建博客的好处是我觉得静态网页更加容易打理而且非常漂亮。选择部署在GitHub上也是比较方便而且是免费的。调试阶段发现还有一些bug需要修正，网站在以后还会继续的改进，并且分享一些好玩的东西。

如果你觉得这个博客很有意思的话，那么走过路过的就赏点小钱和红包作为我的创业基金吧，以后小卖部成功开业少不了你的辣条。(Just Joking)

Hi, this is Mr.zhou. I have my portfolio and blog deployed on Github Pages using Jekyll just for fun. One thing I found that was fascinating about it was that I can take good care of website with jekyll and it looks artistically gorgeous like a work of art. Deployment of a website on Gitbub is definetely easy and free of charge as long as you do not make a singer repository bigger than 1 GB, otherwise you will get a warm greeting email from github technical team.I hope I can keep posting and updating in the future. As I said, everything is just for fun.
